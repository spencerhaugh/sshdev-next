Looking back at this app\'s original codebase was a journey. I remember the struggle and the frustration. I built this app originally in Vue (it was a project requirement to use a technology that was new to us), but for v2 I am using React. These days, at my day job I am building with Angular, and I wanted to make sure I stayed sharp in React as well.',
